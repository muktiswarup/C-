In C++, operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. C++ supports a wide variety of operators, categorized into different types based on their functionality. Here's an overview:

1. Arithmetic Operators
+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder of division)
2. Relational Operators
== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to
3. Logical Operators
&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR
! : Logical NOT
4. Bitwise Operators
& : Bitwise AND
| : Bitwise OR
^ : Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
~ : Bitwise NOT (complement)
<< : Left shift
>> : Right shift
5. Assignment Operators
= : Simple assignment
+= : Add and assign
-= : Subtract and assign
*= : Multiply and assign
/= : Divide and assign
%= : Modulus and assign
&= : Bitwise AND and assign
|= : Bitwise OR and assign
^= : Bitwise XOR and assign
<<= : Left shift and assign
>>= : Right shift and assign
6. Unary Operators
++ : Increment
-- : Decrement
- : Unary minus
+ : Unary plus (rarely used)
! : Logical NOT
~ : Bitwise NOT
7. Other Operators
sizeof : Returns the size of a variable or data type
?: : Ternary operator (conditional)
, : Comma operator (used to separate expressions)
-> : Access members of a structure through a pointer
. : Access members of a structure or class
[] : Array subscript
() : Function call
